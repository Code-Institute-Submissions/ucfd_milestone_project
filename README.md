NAME:  GIANCARLO FIORLETTA
MILESTONE PROJECT NAME:  USER CENTRIC FRONTEND DEVELOPMENT

INTRODUCTION:
In this project I have created a frontend website to meet the needs of my clients, The Monkees.

AIMS:
The main aims of the project are as follows...

1)  To make a website that appeals to fans of the Monkees 
2)  To allow fans to get access to music, video and pictures from the band
3)  To allow users to get information on new music from the band
4)  To enable users to hire the band for events

The website should also be responsive so that it works across all devices and media sizes.  It should be intuitive and easy for the user to use.

USER STORIES:
To understand what fans of the Monkees might be looking for from the band I have created a number of user stories to help guide the content of the website.

Story 1:  As a fan of the Monkees, I want to see pictures of the band because I was fond of how they looked in their early career and am interested 
to see how they've changed.

Story 2: As a music lover, I want to hire a famous band so that I can have a memorable anniversary party and impress my friends.

Story 3:  As a fan of the Monkees, I want to listen to some of their music and see their videos because they make me happy.

Story 4:  As a fan of the Monkees, I want to know if the Monkees release any new material as I loved their old tracks.

The above user stories justify the proposed content requested by the band and on the basis of the above it will be important to include a
landing page that highlights all of the content available, a page to host their music, one containing their video, another to showcase their
photos and a method for fans to both sign up to their mailing list and get in touch to request them for hire.

A wireframe was created using a free application called pencil to try to get an idea of the layout of the landing page which would be broken into 
multiple sections, a sign up section call out above the navbar, the navbar itself, the title header consisting of a picture of the four band members and 
a welcome statement.  This would be followed by a section to introduce the music avaiable, followed by the video and then the pictures.  There would be a
section that followed to highlight the bands availability and finally a footer with some information about the band and links to their social media.
